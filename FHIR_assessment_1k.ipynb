    "**OVERVIEW**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to FHIR!\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2009, the U.S. HITECH Act introduced the concept of “Meaningful Use”.  Meaningful Use was intended to drive “useful” adoption of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) by providing $27B for EHR adoption incentives.  This explosion of EHR adoption drove the need for computer systems interoperability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin the first class of this eight week quarter with an overview of the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and jump right into performing queries to a FHIR database using a tool called Open EMR as well as Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in general, FHIR is focused on clinical patient care rather than healthcare research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Learning Objectives of this Assessment are to begin to experiement:\n",
    "- 1.) have specific reasons to browse the FHIR webpage and begin to read the materials\n",
    "- 2.) use a data browswer to begin to investigate the data accessible server to answer specific questions\n",

    "**Assignment Pre-requisites: **\n",

    "\n",
    "**Set up and initialization: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning the assignment you will need to initialize the JH BIDS \"answer key server\" by adding your jhed_id about 3/4 down the cell block below and then executing.  Verify the success message at the bottom.   "

    "*Congratulations*!  You were recently hired as a software developer in the Johns Hopkins BIDS department.   Here at Johns Hopkins we use the Open EMR system (ok, not really).  You will need to learn how to navigate the EMR, insert data as a clinician, and access data via the FHIR API as a software developer.  But, first you will need to learn how to read the HL7 FHIR standard.\n",

A “Resource” is the definition of a specific item such as a Patient, a Diagnostic Report, or a Medication.  In computer software terms, these are called “object definitions”.  Peruse this webpage to get an idea of Resources which are available, if you have not yet done so.  Please spend a solid amount of time reviewing the FHIR R4 Resources.  Ask yourself some questions about data which you need to critically review and find it.\n",

    "\n",
    "- (a) HL7 v2 was introduced in 1987.\n",
    "- (b) HL7 v2 is transaction (aka message) based.\n",
    "- (c) The data model described in HL7 v2 is not very strong.\n",
    "- (d) “Profiling” was not common in HL7 v2 which infers that a lot of customization of each message is required to attain interoperability between every pair of systems.\n",
    "- (e) HL7 v2 interface engines (message reformatting and redistribution) are common in most healthcare institutions.\n",
    "- (f) Every system supporting HL7 v2 must retain copies of the data in its own database.\n",
    "- (g) Every medical system with a database requires a very careful and often complicated database backup plan for that type of database (e.g., SQLServer, mySQL, postgress, Oracle, etc.)\n",
    "- (h) Every system supporting HL7 v2 must accept and accurately implement updates for every type of HL7 v2 message the system supports to keep every single system in sync.\n",
    "- (i) HL7 v2 supports a query mechanism and the query mechanism is supported by almost all systems in a healthcare institution today.\n",
    "- (j) HL7 v2 messaging is very prevalent in most healthcare systems today."
